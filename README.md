We created a 3D printed exoskeleton prototype for a 14 year old who lost the use of the lower half of her arm.  An arduino is hooked up to a stepper motor to retract string that would allow the user to clench an object.  The rotary angle sensor detects the angle at which the user's arm would be and is the input to tell the motor to start.

This project was done for VCU's healthhacks hackathon from October 1-2 2016.
